The role of experimentation platforms for IoT data and service providers is crucial for building systems that can evolve to meet high levels of service quality. These systems should be highly resilient and include feedback mechanisms that provide a quality assessment of different aspects of the data ranging from annotation compliance to the consistency of frequency. To have an end-to-end testing environment that covers the whole data flow from source to consumer, employing testing or staging instances is essential not only for internal testing within the testbed organisation but also for offering external testing services to third parties. 

IoT experimentation assumes that a testbed/data provider provides the collected data to third parties (example researchers) for running experiments. This requires sharing the data with external parties that are not the data owners. Thereby raising privacy concerns if external parties mishandle the data. The latest EU directive for data protection (GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)) sets strict guidelines on the collection and processing of user data. IoT systems are required to be compliant with these guidelines because, in most cases, they handle user-generated data. For example, consider a user participating in a crowd-sourcing based environmental monitoring testbed where he has installed an application on his mobile phone. A third party having access to the data produced by these mobile devices may be able to interpret private user information such as his home location. Thus, one important aspect of the provided data is its privacy and the context in which the IoT devices (such as mobile phones) capture it. 

For a multi-domain experimentation facility, depending on the association with the real-world entities, the nature, and intention of the data consumption, it is important to provide a flexible means to configure the level of data privacy. With the introduction of GDPR athe need to have a model that reflects the concepts defined by these laws is essential. This requires modelling the roles of different actors, the consent mechanism, and the consumer's permissions on what they can consume.


Most of the past activities in IoT experimentation were only focused on developing the fundamental technologies to facilitate the provision of experimentation services on top of shared testbeds, but neglected the important aspect of privacy. Data marketplace platforms such as Big-IoT, Inter-IoT and Wise-IoT do provide interoperability but do not focus on data and its privacy. Another platform such as FIESTA-IoT, although is semantically enabled and provides a module to define user authorization, but it does not include data privacy. However, its semantic power enables IoT testbeds from different domains to federate their data easily, test end-to-end services, collect feedback on performance and provide experimenters easy to use one stop data marketplace APIs. The FIESTA-IoT platform allows testbed to annotate resources and observations by combining concepts from several well-known IoT ontologies. It also defines a taxonomy for the different sensor/actuator devices, phenomena and measurement units adopted across multiple IoT domains.

This motivates us to propose a privacy-enhanced ontology specifically designed for IoT experimentation (that can be easily generalised for generic IoT systems) which includes the main concepts of privacy (as extracted by GDPR and ISO/IEC 29100) and help achieve interoperability between testbeds. Thus, the main contributions of this work are as follows:

- **Ontology alignment**: We follow the methodology proposed by Noy et al. and align our ontology to use standard and most popular ontologies such as SSN so that semantic interoperability can be easily achieved between semantically enabled IoT testbeds/data-providers.
- **Addition of privacy related concepts**: We include essential concepts in the ontology, as per guidelines, required for enabling privacy aware experimentation.
