<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Experimentation is crucial for building systems that can evolve to meet high levels of service quality. IoT data that belong to users and from which their personal information can be inferred are frequently shared in the background with third parties for experimentation and building quality services. This data sharing raises privacy concerns especially since in most cases the data are gathered and shared without the user's knowledge or consent. With the introduction of GDPR, experimentation platforms that federate data from different testbeds and data providers must be privacy enabled. We propose an IoT ontology built using available standards that enhances privacy, enables semantic interoperability between testbeds, and allows experimentation. On top, we propose recommendations on how to efficiently use our proposed ontology within IoT testbeds or an IoT data federating platform. Our ontology is evaluated for different quality assessment criteria using standard ontology evaluation tools.</span>
